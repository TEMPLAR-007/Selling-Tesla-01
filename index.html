            <h1> <span class="name">Tesla</span> World<span class="lite-color">[lite]</span> !</h1>
            <h3>In order to have clean air in cities, you have to go electric</h3>
            <p> This is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make
                products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean
                transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and
                storage
                already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we
                want.

            <h3>Beyond Ludicrous</h3>
            <p> With the longest range and quickest acceleration of any electric vehicle in production, Model S Plaid is
                the highest performing sedan ever built. All Model S powertrains, with updated battery architecture, are
                capable of back-to-back, consistent 1/4 mile runs.
